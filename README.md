## Page Requirements

### Home (`/`)
- Fetch all countries from the API on load using `useEffect`
- Display each country as a card showing its **flag** and **name**
- Clicking a card navigates to `/country/:name` — use the country's common name as the URL param
- Show a loading message while data is being fetched

### CountryDetail (`/country/:name`)
- Read the country name from the URL using `useParams`
- Fetch that country's data from the API on load
- Decide what information to display — at minimum show the flag and name
- Include a back button that returns to the previous page using `useNavigate`

### Build (`/build`)
- Display two links: **Build a Web App** and **Build a Mobile App**
- Show a message: *"Select an option to get started"*
- Use `<NavLink>` so the active link is visually highlighted
- Use `<Outlet />` to render the selected child route below the links

### Web (`/build/web`)
- Static page with dummy content about building a country web app
- Suggested content: tools to use (React, Vite), what pages to build, tips for displaying flag images

### Mobile (`/build/mobile`)
- Static page with dummy content about building a country mobile app
- Suggested content: tools to use (React Native, Expo), differences from web, tips for mobile layout

### About (`/about`)
- Static page — write a short description of the app and the API it uses
